# Config: UI Theme `ui-theme`

Each page can be assigned a theme, which will be used to render the page. The theme is a collection of colors that control the look and feel of the widgets.

## Colors

<PropsTable property="colors" :hide-dynamic="true"/>

## Sizes

<PropsTable property="sizes" :hide-dynamic="true"/>

## Example

Example Config of `ui-theme` in Node-RED:

<img src="/images/theme-config.png" alt="Example config for a Theme" width="350"/>

Resulting Dashboard with the theme applied:

![Resulting Dashboard with applied theme](/images/theme-example.png "Resulting Dashboard with applied theme"){data-zoomable}

Colors here were chosen to make it easier to differentiate between the different groups rather than it being aesthetically pleasing.
